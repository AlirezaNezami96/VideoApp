# Video App

This repository contains the source code for a video application that uses the The [Pixabay Video API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_videos). This app is a fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It follows Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a useful reference for developers. The application is well-documented and follows best practices like Google's **NowInAndroid** repository for code reusability. It is also user-friendly and easy to navigate.

You can download the APK to install on you device with this link ðŸ‘‡

# Features
The application has four main screens:

-   **Home**: This screen lists videos with the following orders: **Popular** and **Latest**.
-   **Video Detail**: This screen displays detailed information about the selected video, such as its **Thumbnail, User name and avatar, list of tags, Number of downloads, Number of Views, Number of Likes, Number of Comments** and user is able to mark/unmark the video as **Bookmark**.
-   **Search**: This screen allows users to search for videos by title or keyword.

# Architecture
The **Video** app follows the [official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) and is built on **MVI** architecture. The Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture is a design pattern used in Android app development. It focuses on **unidirectional** data flow and separation of concerns to create more predictable and testable code. Here's a brief overview of the MVI architecture in Android:

**Model ,View ,Intent ,ViewModel ,Reducer, Dispatcher**

## The application is built using the following technologies:
-   Kotlin
-   MVI architecture
-   Jetpack Compose
-   Material Design 3
-   Dagger / Hilt
-   The Pixabay videos API
-   Room database
-   Kotlin Coroutines
-   Kotlin Flow

# UI
The app was designed using  [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/). Right now it's only in dark mode but it can be setup as light mode and use dynamic colors (for Android 12+) by just setting the proper colors.

The Screens and UI elements are built entirely using  [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

# Modularization
The  **Video**  app has been fully modularized and it contains app, core and features modules.
The app module, contains the logic for the Application and single Activity class for showing the **composable screens** application and app's navigation using **Navigation Compose**.
The core module, contain various modules inside it that providing data to the feature modules. It has:

- **Common**: Includes all the util classes using across the app's modules
- **Data**: Manages data operations, abstracts data sources, and provides a consistent interface for data retrieval and storage.
- **Database**: Handles data persistence and provides methods for storing and retrieving data from local databases. **(Room ORM)**
- **Domain**: Contains the business logic and defines the operations and rules that govern the application's behavior.
- **Model**: represents the data structures and entities used within the application, facilitating data manipulation and communication between different layers.
- **Network**: handles network operations, such as making API requests, handling responses, and managing network connectivity.


# Development Environment
**Video App**  uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into Android Studio.

Change the run configuration to  `app`.

# Build
To build and run the VideoApp, follow these steps:
1. First, you need a API-KEY. to obtain one, you need to Signup from the [Pixabay website](https://pixabay.com/accounts/register/?source=&next=/api/docs/)
2. Clone the repository.
3. After registration, copy your API-KEY and paste it inside the local.properties file like this:
   PIXABAY_API_KEY=**Paste you API-KEY here**

4. Open the project in Android Studio.

5.  Ensure that your Android SDK is up to  date  with the specified `minSdk` and `targetSdk` versions.
6. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.
